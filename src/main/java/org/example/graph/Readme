Graph Representation
1. Adjacency list
2. Adjacency matrix
3. edge list

Shortest path in a graph
1. Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) for unweighted graphs, where shortest path is the one with the least number of edges.
2. Use Topological Sort + DFS (Depth-First Search) for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
3. Use Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs with non-negative weights.
4. Use Bellman-Ford algorithm for graphs with negative weights.

Minimum spanning tree in a graph
1. Prim's algorithm - greedy algorithm that starts with a single node and iteratively adds the closest unvisited node.
2. Kruskal's algorithm - greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree by iteratively adding edges in increasing order of weight.

topological Sorting
1. DFS based
2. Kahn's BFS based

Strongly Connected Components
1. Kosaraju Algorithm
